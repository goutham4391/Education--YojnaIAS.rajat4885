<p><b>Significance for Mains:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Obstacles in India’ sports architecture; Government Initiatives in sports; Way forward to improve sports governance; Concept of Soft power; Chinese strategy to attain soft power through international sporting events.</span></p>
<p><b>News: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Good performance of Indian athletes in Tokyo Olympics and then the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games (CWG) ushered in the golden era of Indian sports.</span></p>
<p><b>Outcomes of medals won by India in International sports events:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> At the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, Indian athletes won 61 medals, including 22 golds. India won seven medals at Tokyo olympics including one gold of Neeraj Chopra.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">It provided pride to every Indian citizen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">It demonstrates the country’s soft power on the global stage </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">It paves the way towards India&#8217;s status as a great “geopolitical actor”.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Obstacles in India’s sport architecture:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Poorest population-to-medal ratios in olympics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">According to  “Indian Olympic medal winners: A comprehensive list” article   India just won 35 medals at the Olympics since the 1900 edition. Country with 1.3 billion-plus people,this performance is disappointing.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Lack of a favourable sports atmosphere</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to polish the skills of early-stage athletes due to low and scant exposure of Indians to sports at the elementary school level hampering India’s professional engagement in sports. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Low spending on sports:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> India spends only three paise per day per capita on sports on the other hand China spends ₹6.1 per day per capita.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Politicization of Sports governance: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Most sports organisations are governed by the politicians.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Other major issues</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> are absence of competent coaches,inadequate funding and lack of sports academics.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Indian initiatives:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) launched by the Ministry of Sports </b><span style="font-weight: 400">to improve India’s performance at the Olympics and Paralympics: It provides extra monetary assistance to athletes  and training from the best national and international coaches. </span></li>
<li><b>NITI Aayog report in 2016: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">A 20-point plan to improve India’s Olympics performance.</span></li>
<li><b>High viewership of Tokyo Olympic Games attributed to the increase in viewership in India:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Tokyo Olympic Games were watched by over 3.05 billion people, ‘a 74% increase in digital viewers from Rio 2016’. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Way forward: </b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Implement recommendations of NITI Aayog to improve things in sports: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">NITI Aayog recommended government efforts at the family, community to school, regional academies, State and national levels.</span><b> </b></li>
<li><b>Separation of sports from politics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Former players should lead sports organisations.</span></li>
<li><b>Memorandum of understanding(MoUs) with nations that excel in specific sports to train Indian players overseas. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">For example: Help from Australia and the United Kingdom can be taken for developing the talent pool in swimming. Collaborating with African countries such as Kenya for running.</span></li>
<li><b>India can also assist other countries in developing certain sports like Cricket and Kabaddi. </b><span style="font-weight: 400">For Example: India can positively reply to China’s request for Indian assistance in cricket development in China (Chongqing city).</span></li>
<li><b>Increase the number of athletes training under TOPS for a competitive sports climate.</b></li>
<li><b>Harnessing private investment  to develop sports infrastructure: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Country’s performance in sporting events are interlinked with private investments in sports atmosphere.</span></li>
<li><b>Development of corporate sports programmes </b><span style="font-weight: 400">for active corporate participation and  investments in sports.</span><b>  </b></li>
<li><b>Focus on Public-private partnership (PPP) model </b><span style="font-weight: 400">for development of basic sporting infrastructure at the district level.</span><b> </b></li>
</ul>

<td><b>About Soft power:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the late 1980s, American political scientist </span><b>Joseph Nye Jr.</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> defined </span><b>“Soft power”</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> as a  “power of attraction through culture, political ideas, and policies rather than coercion” exhibited by that military hard power.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, nations are investing in attaining soft power through international sporting events, which they are trying to achieve by investing more and doing well in elite sports. Even smaller nations increased their interest in international sporting events.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Soft power in itself is not an end but a means to achieve  an end.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Utilization of International sporting events as an instrument for attaining Soft power by China:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Research conducted by  Dongfeng Liu (International Professor of Sport Management for the Shanghai campus of the Sport Business School) showed that China’s Olympic achievement has a positive effect on its national soft power.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Undemocratic countries like China, Russia and North Korea having shoddy human rights records used the Olympics or other world championships for brand building and changing preception.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">China builds “people-to-people” relations with other countries through  its superiority in elite sports. For example: China trains athletes from African countries such as Madagascar in swimming, badminton, table tennis, etc. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">China’s memorandum of understanding with countries helps Beijing  in building better formal relations through creating a positive impact on a wider population.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Significance for Prelims: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Hambantota port; East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM); Gilgit-Baltistan region</span></p>
<p><b>Significance for Mains: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Power Politics in Central Asia;Pakistan as stabilising factor in Central Asia and Afghanistan; Limitation of China and Pakistan in Geo-Politics; Internal Security issues in Pakistan</span></p>
<p><b>News: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, US-China rivalry enters Central Asia. China is overcoming nuclear disparity with the US with the help of Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><b>Major Geo-political powers and Central Asia: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>United States of America(U.S.A):</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> US’s counterterrorism efforts involve  “secure and stable” Central Asia  and Afghanistan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>China: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">SCO is led by China but does not have an ostensible anti-US tilt. The arc of Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan is crucial to Chinese security interests.But, currently China is reluctant to provide a security umbrella to Central Asia or Afghanistan. Central Asia is part of Chinese ambition of becoming a pre-eminent Asiatic power. China also aims to spread their footprints in the Indian Ocean region; the recent docking of Chinese-built Pakistani frigate PNS Taimur at the Colombo port and China’s spy ship Yuan Wang 5 at Hambantota port can be seen in this direction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Russia:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Continuous Ukraine war exhausted  Russian resources to spare for security situations across Central Asia. Russia may also face the spillover of the deteriorating security situation of Afghanistan or due to the presence of 8,000 to 10,000 foreign fighters in Afghanistan hailing from the north Caucasus region of Russia, Pakistan and China’s Xinjiang province,</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Role of Pakistan in ensuring power parity between China and U.S.A in Central Asia:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">China is coordinating with Pakistan across the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">arc of Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and beyond to weaken competition from the US across the Indian Ocean region.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pakistan also ensures safety of Chinese staff in its country by cracking down on insurgents in the tribal belt in Pakistan. When seven Chinese staff were abducted from a Chinese massage parlour by a “vice and virtue” group of Jamia Hafsa seminary in July 2007, Pakistan’s army initiated operations from Lal Masjid in Islamabad.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pakistan helped the Taliban to reach out to the larger world including  Central Asia and China resulting in tactical silence in Afghanistan from  East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM)  and Central Asian terror groups.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Proxy games played by Pakistan across the arc and beyond using diplomacy as smokescreen put other states in the region at the cusp of  violence regarding border engagement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pakistan played a defining role in the US-Taliban agreement in February 2020.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Deep state of Pakistan i.e. ISI promoted terror groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP)  for lone-wolf acts of terrorism and extremism. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">China -Pakistan coordination can be seen from the fact of consistent hardening of stance on Line of Actual Control( LAC) with India and holding UN designations of Pakistan-backed terror operatives like Sajid Mir. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Pakistan as an </span><span style="font-weight: 400">“all-weather” nuclear friend of China </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> will help China to achieve nuclear parity with the United States.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Limitation of Pakistan’s help to China:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Deteriorating security situation in Pakistan</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> due to direct attacks by Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in tribal areas, including those  in Peshawar and the Swat Valley. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Disturbance in Gilgit-Baltistan region</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> due to  frequent hostage situations  created by local TTP fighters of Gilgit-Baltistan to fulfill their demands.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Rise in Baloch separatism:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> Recently, Baloch Liberation Army took  army personnel hostage for negotiating the release of Baloch cadres. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Failure of the Taliban-mediated talks</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> between the TTP and the Pakistan army. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Increased incidents of targeted attacks on Chinese interests</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Pakistan by the “bad” Taliban as well as Baloch groups after Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Even after engaging deeply with the Taliban</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> ( Mullah Baradar as a Chinese state guest in July 2021) China’s direct influence in Afghanistan remains limited.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Conclusion: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Pakistan is a stabilizing factor in the arc of Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Even the US has “calibrated” its  US response towards “dangerous”  Pakistan  to challenge Chinese moves involving Pakistan.But, unlike the on-and-off US-Pakistan engagements, China-Pakistan cooperation is deep spanning the entire gamut of security and geopolitical areas. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IAS – Indian Administrative Services formerly known as Imperial Civil Service – ICS is a bureaucracy of India. Through the IAS UPSC CSE exam, the conducting body recruits candidates for the All-India Services such as Indian Administrative Services (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), IRS, etc. Although regarded as one of the toughest exams in the country, with the right approach and strategy, an aspirant can crack the IAS examination in the very first attempt. The IAS exam is conducted in three phases that are Prelims, Mains, and Interview phases.</p>
<p>The Mains Exam includes optional subjects and you have the full freedom to choose your preferred UPSC optional subjects. The Optional Subject plays a great role in being the score-differentiator for UPSC aspirants. In the CSE Main exam, out of the nine papers, two papers, Paper VI and Paper VII are from the optional subject for UPSC. They are optional Subject Paper 1 and Optional Subject Paper 2. Each of them carries 250 marks. So, the UPSC optional subject carries 500/1750 marks in the UPSC Mains Exam. The marks obtained in the UPSC optional subjects are considered for the preparation of final merit. Hence, the choice of an optional subject for UPSC must be made cautiously. Unlike the earlier times, candidates have to now choose just one optional subject.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IAS &#8211; Indian Administrative Services formerly known as Imperial Civil Service &#8211; ICS is a bureaucracy of India. Through the IAS UPSC CSE exam, the conducting body recruits candidates for the All-India Services such as Indian Administrative Services (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), IRS, etc. Although regarded as one of the toughest exams in the country, with the right approach and strategy, an aspirant can crack the IAS examination in the very first attempt. The IAS exam is conducted in three phases that are Prelims, Mains, and Interview phases.</p>
<p>The Mains Exam includes optional subjects and you have the full freedom to choose your preferred UPSC optional subjects. The Optional Subject plays a great role in being the score-differentiator for UPSC aspirants. In the CSE Main exam, out of the nine papers, two papers, Paper VI and Paper VII are from the optional subject for UPSC. They are optional Subject Paper 1 and Optional Subject Paper 2. Each of them carries 250 marks. So, the UPSC optional subject carries 500/1750 marks in the UPSC Mains Exam. The marks obtained in the UPSC optional subjects are considered for the preparation of final merit. Hence, the choice of an optional subject for UPSC must be made cautiously. Unlike the earlier times, candidates have to now choose just one optional subject.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Source:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Indian Express</span></p>
<p><b>News: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">LVM3 M2/OneWeb India-1 mission of  Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) carried almost 6 tonnes payload  into lower-earth orbit, highest of any ISRO mission.</span></p>
<p><b>Features of some rockets:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>LMV3 rocket:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes. In lower earth orbits or LEO (200 km from the Earth’s surface ) it can carry merely  8 tonnes. Further in geostationary transfer orbits or GTO ( about 35,000 km from Earth) it can carry  only about 4 tonnes. Additional thrust during liftoff (a liquid stage, and a cryogenic stage) is provided by solid fuels in the boosters in LMV3 rockets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ariane 5 rockets: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rockets are  frequently used by ISRO for its heavy payloads. Ariane 5 rockets  can carry 20-tonne payloads to lower earth orbits and 10 tonnes to GTO. These rockets  have a lift-off mass of 780 tonnes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Falcon Heavy rockets from SpaceX:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is the most powerful modern launch vehicle, weighing over 1,400 tonnes at launch time and can carry payloads of  about 60 tonnes.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Operational launch vehicles of India:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Multiple versions of  Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle or PSLV: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the most commonly used launch vehicle. Since 1993, it has carried 53 successful missions and failed twice</span><b>. </b></li>
<li><b>Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle or GSLV Mk-II:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ISRO carried 14 missions through GSLV-MkII rocket of which four have ended in failures.</span></li>
<li><b>Launch Vehicle Mark-3 or LVM3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Success rate of LVM3 in its five missions(including the Chandrayaan 2 mission) is 100 percent . </span></li>
<li><b>ISRO is developing  a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">that can be brought back and refurbished for multiple use. It can prevent space pollution as  RLV would not end up in space as waste. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b> Need for Heavier rockets:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indigenously developed heavier rockets can carry heavier payloads, or venture much deeper into space. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavier rockets like the LVM3 rocket can accommodate the change in engines and fuel required for deeper space missions. </span></li>
<li><b>Reduce the inefficiency of space missions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space journey consists of tremendous gravitational resistance.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">To overcome “tyranny of the rocket equation”.</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Relevance of  LVM3 M2/OneWeb mission:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success of the flight validated the LVM3 rocket, ISRO’s most important missions like the Gaganyaan. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launch of LVM3 M2/OneWeb mission affirmed ISRO’s claim as a serious player in the heavy satellite launch market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LVM3 rocket (earlier GSLV Mk-III ) will end the dependence of ISRO on Ariane rockets of Europe for launching heavy satellites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India can confidently stride into its ambitious space programmes manned missions, Moon landings and deep space explorations</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Way forward for future missions: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufacturing rockets that can make multiple trips and its  components of larger structures  can be assembled in space like the International Space Station.</span></li>
</ul>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>From Lodha to Ramana: the Chief Justices of the Modi era</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">The Supreme Court (SC) of India known as the  custodian of the Indian Constitution.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Primary responsibility of the SC:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> To ensure protection of fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed under the Constitution from the state.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Supreme Court emerges as the most powerful court among other courts of the world due to:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Its power of judicial review through its decision in Keshavananda Bharati case.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">It assumed the power of judicial appointments to itself and High Courts through various judgements in first judge, second judge and third judge cases and CJI is appointed through seniority convention.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">SC of India ensures the citizens wide ranging protections by expanding scope of the fundamental right to life and liberty  guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Provision of  Public interest litigation(PIL) through which common citizens approach the courts even by sending a letter.</span></li>
<li><b>Powerful Chief Justice of India (CJI): </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides performing normal judicial duties. CJI is responsible for selecting judges for appointment to the higher judiciary and deciding the number and composition of benches to adjudicate on different kinds of cases.</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Evolution of the office of CJI: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">It  is a classic example of a constant shifting and rebalancing of power between the judiciary and the executive.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>From 1950 to 1971: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">During this period CJI had complete authority over judicial appointments, and CJI can even veto any judicial appointments.</span></li>
<li><b>Between 1971 and 1993: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Executive became strong due to strong single party central governments and executive started appointing ‘committed judges’ to the Supreme Court, in a clear attempt  to change the size of Supreme Court in its favor. SC in  ‘first judges’ case (1981) or  SP Gupta case held that the opinion of the Chief Justice of India would not be binding on the government.</span></li>
<li><b>In the second judge’s case (1993) </b><span style="font-weight: 400">creation of Judicial primacy and the collegium took place. Through the second judge case of 1993 the judiciary seized the power of appointments back from the executive. </span></li>
<li><b>After 2014: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the rise of the Narendra Modi-led BJP government single party majority the executive is once again back in control and as a consequence of it the power of the judiciary is weaker than before and  weak judiciary is unable to control autocratic tendencies of the executive such as communal polarisation, misuse of investigating agencies and slow destruction of democratic institutions etc.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>CJIs of the Modi era (2014 &#8211; 2022):</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Just after ending the tenure as CJI ,</span><b>Justice P. Sathasivam</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> was appointed as Governor of Kerala  without an appropriate cooling period against the own policy of BJP govt.After the NJAC judgment, matters were still not settled, and the memorandum of procedure for appointments to the higher judiciary became the centrepiece of the dispute between the executive and the judiciary</span></li>
<li><b>Tenure of Justice R.M. Lodha: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">He revived the dormant trend of direct appointments from  Bar to the Bench in the Supreme Court.This practice was permitted under the Constitution, but rarely attempted.Justice Lodha was also famous for report on reforms in the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The Executive under the Modi government first confronted the judiciary when it refused the appointment of Gopal Subramaniam as judge of SC.</span></li>
<li><b>Tenure of Justice H.L. Dattu: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">His tenure was known for the first major confrontation between the executive and the judiciary.Judiciary struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act.But, Supreme Court failed to fix the flaws in the NJAC Act, by addressing its shortcomings. Memorandum of procedure for appointments to the higher judiciary remains the centerpiece of the dispute between the executive and the judiciary.</span></li>
<li><b>Justice T.S. Thakur: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">He highlighted the plight of the overburdened Indian judiciary and  worked actively for mechanisms of filling up vacancies.He was responsible for setting up the National Judicial Data Grid to connect all levels of the judicial system and to  provide easy information to litigants.He fell in conflict with Modi government  when he attempted about 20 transfers of judges across High Courts.Due to ambiguous nature of the  decision and since it is threatening independence and overall integrity of the judiciary, he had to reverse  his decision.</span></li>
<li><b>Justice J.S. Khehar: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Many landmark judgments such as  Right to Privacy and Triple Talaq were passed during his short tenure. He  also revived the debates on the lack of transparency and fairness in managing the roster in the Supreme Court.His response towards procedure followed by him when allegations were made against him in a suicide note of Kalikho Pul ( former Arunachal Pradesh CM)was without precedent and also without propriety.In a complete disregard of basic principles of natural justice and clear case of conflict of interest, Justice Khehar chose to list the letter written by Pul’s wife seeking permission to file an FIR against the judges mentioned in the  as a writ petition (converting an administrative question into a judicial one).In his tenure High Court judge, Justice C.S. Karnan, was convicted and imprisoned for contempt of court but some experts felt that decision was unconstitutional  as it overlooked  Parliament’s exclusive privilege to remove a member of the higher judiciary in an act.</span></li>
<li><b>Justice Dipak Misra:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> During his tenure four fellow judges held an unprecedented press conference condemning the CJI’s internal administrative decisions, specifically related to disregard for court conventions of bench strength and bench composition in the allocation of cases.Impeachment motion was also proceeded against him in parliament which was as eventually quashed by the Rajya Sabha.Issue of the master of roster and conflict of interest also emerged during his tenure.Justice Misra tried to achieve a balance between adjudication and disposal  and known for setting up the maximum number of constitutional benches as CJI.</span></li>
<li><b>Justice Ranjan Gogoi: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">He had been party to the unprecedented press conference held by judges.But during his tenure he  disregarded the conflict of interest when he sat in the hearing of a sexual harassment complaint made by an employee of the Supreme Court against himself breaking all principles of natural justice.He was obsessed with secrecy, and preferred information to be submitted to the court in ‘sealed covers’ and this was employed in Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) matter, the Rafale dispute, the electoral bonds issue.His tenure gave rise of the ‘executive court’ when judiciary took over the executive’s role in NRC.He refused to admit habeas corpus petitions filed from Jammu &amp; Kashmir in the wake of the abrogation of Article 370.He gave rise to the practice of ‘judicial evasion’ as Supreme Court avoided hearing certain cases altogether such as the electoral bonds case, the Citizenship Amendment Act case, the abrogation of Article 370, etc.He also accepted an appointment as a Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) soon after retirement which he opposed during his judicial tenure. Also there is increased interference of  executive and legislative in the matters of the judiciary. Also the tendency towards sycophancy started among Supreme Court judges, some judges like Justice Arun Mishra and Justice M.R. Shah publicly praised the PM. His Bench also concluded the long-standing Ayodhya dispute.</span></li>
<li><b>Justice Sharad A. Bobde: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">He has the longest tenure in the Modi era.Judiciary experimented boldly with technology, but it also shows greater subservience towards the government.Judicial evasion continued in his tenure. In his period the Court gave preferential treatment to certain matters, for example, in the bail matters of journalists Siddique Kappan versus Arnab Goswami. He stayed the farm laws and set up a committee to examine the law  that seems to be biased in favor of law. He discouraged the use of Article 32 petitions as a means of approaching the court.He tried to take away the right to adjudicate on COVID cases from High Courts.Supreme Court’s attitude towards plight of migrant laborers in India during the pandemic was blight.In his tenure there was a case of stand off within the collegium when Justice Bobde was reluctant to recommend Justice Akil Kureshi to the Supreme Court which was recommended by Justice Nariman.</span></li>
<li><b>Justice N.V. Ramana: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">He started the judiciary&#8217;s  engagement  with the public through his speeches and brought back some of the old glory of the Supreme Court. He once again revived the ‘sentinel on the qui vive’ of the Judicial institution. He improved the public confidence in the judiciary through certain bail orders and stays (e.g., sedition), and the Pegasus inquiry. But some judgments from his associate judges during his tenure seriously undermined civil liberties.Court’s  decision on the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (the Watali case), had the effect of virtually detaining people for an indefinite period. The Supreme Court was held responsible for criminalizing petitioners who dared to approach the Court on civil liberty matters for example, The Teesta Setalvad/Zakia Jafri and Himanshu Kumar cases.To improve the diversity in the system he appointed many women judges and made a significantly large number of appointments in the higher judiciary to fill all the vacancies of the SC. But, despite efforts to improve the image of the judiciary, the practice of judicial evasion continued and no constitutional Benches were formed in Justice Ramana’s term.</span><b>Current CJI of SC is U.U. Lalit:</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> He improved  processes of filing and listing of cases</span><b>.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">He initiated certain orders such as granting bail to individuals in the Kappan and Setalvad cases.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Future Challenges and responsibilities of SC/Judiciary:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Protect the judiciary from powerful executives.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Strengthening the Indian judiciary, especially the lower courts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Evolving the office of the CJI in the right direction.</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IAS is the most requested and topmost bureaucrat of India. They have de facto power in the administration of the country.
